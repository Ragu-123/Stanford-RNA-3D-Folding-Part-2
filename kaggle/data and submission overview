Dataset Description
In this competition you will predict five 3D structures for each RNA sequence.

Files
[train/validation/test]_sequences.csv - the target sequences of the RNA molecules.

target_id - (string) An arbitrary identifier. In train_sequences.csv, this is formatted as pdb_id_chain_id, where pdb_id is the id of the entry in the Protein Data Bank and chain_id is the chain id of the monomer in the pdb file.
sequence - (string) The RNA sequence of all chains in the target, concatenated together according to stoichiometry
temporal_cutoff - (string) The date in yyyy-mm-dd format that the sequence was or will be published.
description - (string) Details of the origins of the sequence. For PDB entries, this is the entry title.
stoichiometry - (string) the chains used for the target. These take the form of {chain:number}, where chain corresponds to the author-defined chain in all_sequences, joined with a semicolon delimiter (;).
all_sequences - (string) FASTA-formatted sequences of all molecular chains present in the experimentally solved structure. May include multiple copies of the target RNA (look for the word "Chains" in the header) and/or partners like other RNAs or proteins or DNA. You don't need to make predictions for all these molecules, just the ones specified in stoichiometry which are concatenated in sequence. Can be parsed into a dictionary with extra/parse_fasta_py.py.
ligand_ids - (string) three-letter names in PDB chemical component dictionary of any small molecule ligands solved in the experimental structure, joined with a semicolon delimiter (;). You don't need to make predictions for these molecules.
ligand_SMILES - (string) SMILES strings giving chemical structures of any small molecule ligands solved in the experimental structure, joined with a semicolon delimiter (;).
[train/validation]_labels.csv - experimental structures.

ID - (string) that identifies the target_id and residue number, separated by _. Note: residue numbers use one-based indexing.
resname - (character) The RNA nucleotide ( A, C, G, or U) for the residue.
resid - (integer) residue number.
x_1,y_1,z_1,x_2,y_2,z_2,… - (float) Coordinates (in Angstroms) of the C1' atom for each experimental RNA structure. There is typically one structure for the RNA sequence, and train_labels.csv curates one structure for each training sequence. However, in some targets the experimental method has captured more than one conformation, and each will be used as a potential reference for scoring your predictions.
chain - (string) residue's chain ID. For the target there is one chain assigned to each unique sequence, potentially derived from author-assigned chain in PDB entry. Note: Multiple chains of the molecule can share the same chain if they have the same sequence.
copy - (integer) which chain copy (1,2, …) the residue is in. Greater than 1 if there are multiple copies of the same sequence in the structure.
sample_submission.csv

Same format as train_labels.csv but with five sets of coordinates for each of your five predicted structures (x_1,y_1,z_1,x_2,y_2,z_2,…x_5,y_5,z_5).
You must submit five sets of coordinates.
Note that x,y,z are clipped between -999.999 and 9999.999 before scoring, due to use of a legacy PDB format that has maximal 8 characters for coordinates.
chain and copy do not have to be provided.
MSA/

contains multiple sequence alignments in FASTA format for each target in train_sequences.csv and in validation_sequences.csv. Files are named {target_id}.MSA.fasta. During evaluation with hidden test sequences, your notebook will have access to these MSA files for the hidden test_sequences.csv.
For multi-chain targets, each homolog found for a given chain sequence is presented in a separate row with placeholders for other chain sequences provided as gaps (-).
The header for each homolog encodes the source of the sequence. A tag chain={chain} is appended. If multiple copies of the chain are present in the target, a tag copies={copy} is also appended. Tags are separated by | delimiter.
PDB_RNA/ contains 3D structural information available in the Protein Data Bank with

{PDB_id}.cif files for each RNA-containing entry
pdb_seqres_NA.fasta - sequences of all nucleic acid chains in the PDB in FASTA format.
pdb_release_dates_NA.csv - Entry ID and Release dates of the RNA-containing PDB entries in csv format.
extra/

parse_fasta_py.py - helper script with function parse_fasta(), which can take the all_sequences field of {train/test/validation}_sequences.csv and produce a dictionary of chain:sequence.
rna_metadata.csv - the data extracted from all RNA and RNA/DNA hybrid structures up to December 17,2025
README.md - description of the data in the rna_metadata.csv
Additional notes
The validation_sequences.csv (which is the same as test_sequences.csv publicly provided here) comprise targets released after May 29, 2025, the final submission date of the last Stanford RNA 3D Folding competition, and up to December 17, 2025. These were further filtered to have composition of at least 40% RNA and unique sequences (up to sequence identity 90%).

The train_sequences.csv has not been filtered for sequence redundancy and contains PDB entries released before May 29, 2025 that pass selection criteria and should have no overlap with validation_sequences.csv. Note that train_sequences.csv has been filtered, so it does not have all RNA targets in the PDB to date or all the cif files in PDB_RNA/.

The additional file extra/rna_metadata.csv contains data extracted from all RNA and RNA/DNA hybrid structures up to December 17,2025. The metadata description is included in extra/README.md. These metadata were used to filter the structures that were included in the {train,test,validation}_sequences.csv using the following criteria:

canonical ACGU residues or modified residues that can be mapped to canonical using either PDB chemical component dictionary or NAKB mapping
no undefined (N) residues and no T (for hybrid NA)
no more than 25% of residues that were modified / non-canonical
at least 50% residues reported in the sequence were modeled/observed
total adjusted structuredness (see extra/README.md) of all RNA chains is at least 20%
If any RNA chain in the PDB file didn't meet those criteria, the whole entry has been removed. Additionally the remaining entries were filtered to have at least 10 nt in all chains combined, and entries without resolved C1' atoms (for example P traces) were rejected. Targets in {test,validation}_sequences.csv were further filtered to contain only entries with at least 40% RNA composition and the redundancy was removed by selecting single entry based on MMseqs2 clustering at 90% identity level.
